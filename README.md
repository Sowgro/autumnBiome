# autumnBiome
A Minecraft datapack which adds three autumn biomes, each with different leaf colors. The biomes also contain particle effects and modified water, grass and sky colors to match the fall look. 

Using a datapack allows clients of a server or multiplayer world to see the leaf colors, without the need for client side mods or texture packs. 

These biomes can be applied via worldEdit with the `//setbiome` command.
The worldEdit Spigot plugin does not support custom biomes, you will need to use the worldEdit client-side mod.
